An innovative AI system designed to understand and interact with desktop applications using cutting-edge computer vision and large language models. It can "see" an application's interface, interpret natural language commands, and execute tasks by controlling the GUI.

The functional DOM (fDOM) pipeline is a modular system that automatically discovers UI elements of an application, captures their properties (including dynamic behaviors like hover text or menus), and assembles a structured JSON representation.

Functional DOM (fDOM) is an emergent paradigm for automated, machine-readable mapping of GUI applications. Using advanced perception and automation, our pipeline generates an fDOM JSON artifact that enumerates all visible UI elements, their properties, and initial relationsâ€”enabling both analysis and automation.
